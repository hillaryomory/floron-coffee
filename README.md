    <!-- Step 1 -->
    <div class="mb-6">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gold-600">1. Farmer Registration & Contract Signing</h3>
      <p>
        Farmers join our program by signing a transparent agreement outlining expectations, pricing terms, and support provided by Floron. The contract is fair, clear, and designed to build long-term trust.
